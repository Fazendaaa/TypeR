## Introduction

According to the language site itself, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is:

> [...] is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

Because it is a scripting language, R seeks to allow flexibility in the development and prototyping of ideas. Through its weak typing system this can be a problem for applications in production -- it is worth noting that this is not a "problem" of language since it was meant to behave the way it is, but this same behavior may end becoming a difficulty to maintain a great code base in the language.

**TypeR** tries to be for R what [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), implementing a strong typing system that allows inference and statically typed -- the idea is to go beyond just being types and also to limit the language only to the functional paradigm, cleaning up a little of the multi paradigm of R.

At the end of the day the idea is to write a "functional and typed R code" which will then spit out a normal code in R after all the checks are done, avoiding possible errors when the code is running in production. And if you want to better understand the reason for this decision, you can read more in [functional approach](#Functional-approach); but to give a taste of what this means, the following code...

```R
fibonacci <-function(x) {
  if (0 == x) {
    0
  } else {
    if (1 == x) {
      1
    } else {
      fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2)
    }
  }
}

fibonacci(55)
```

... in an [laptop](https://www.samsung.com/hk_en/pc/notebook-2-np270e5j-k01/) like:

- Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz
- 8GB of RAM:
  - DDR3
  - 1600 MT/s
- 1TB HD:
  - Timing cached reads:   10046 MB in  1.99 seconds = 5038.70 MB/sec
  - Timing buffered disk reads: 300 MB in  3.02 seconds =  99.44 MB/sec
- Manjaro Linux 18.0.4
- Linux 4.19.56-1-MANJARO

## How should it supposed to be

A small example of how language it's supposed to be one day.

**WARNING**: these are just ideas, they may be possible or not.

### Functions

```TypeR
add := Numeric a => a -> a -> a
add <- function(x, y) x + y
```

The function header is similar to Haskell's -- read more at [functional approach](#Functional-approach) --; therefore, it also does not need to be declared, the language engine is able to infer the types of the parameters by the operations performed with them in the function body.

```TypeR
multiply <- function(x, y) x * y
# multiply := Numeric a => a -> a -> a
```

#### Throw notation

If a function throws an error or a warning, the caller has to know that without having to look at the implementation of the function itself.

```TypeR
isURLValid("www.google.com")
# isURLValid := String -> Bool; throws error, warning
```

#### New notation

Maybe add or replace the old function notation with one of those two new notations:

```TypeR
divide <- (x, y) <- x / y
# divide := Numeric a => a -> a -> a
```

Or:

```TypeR
divide x y <- x / y
# divide := Numeric a => a -> a -> a
```

### Constants

```TypeR
result <- add(1, 2)
# result is 3

result <- 4
# This will throw a compiler error, because result is a constant
```

If you want a "constant" to have its value changed, you must use the **let** keyword.

```TypeR
let result <- add(1, 2)
# result is 3

result <- 4
# result is 4
```

### Point free notation

```TypeR
square <- function(x) x ^ 2

addTwo <- function(x) x + 2

result <- addTwo . square 2
# result is 6
```

### Prefix operations

```TypeR
result <- (+) 1 2
# result is 3
```

### Polymorphism

> More on that later on

#### Boundaries

This is the sketch of an idea, it may not be plausible but it proposes to reduce lines of code and facilitate reusability. If you have any knowledge of C / C ++, you may have seen something like:

```C
typedef myNumber unsigned int;
```

The idea is to start from this to the creation of new variables from others, only expanding it to parametric numerical types, imposing limits of sets intervals for them:

```TypeR
typedef Binary int, [0, 1]
typedef ConfidenceLevel double, [0, 1[
typedef MySet double, Binary U ]1.5, 8.9]
```

That would mean being able to do the following:

```TypeR
normalizeDistribution := Vector[Numeric] -> ConfidenceLevel -> Vector[Numeric]
normalizeDistribution <- function(set, level) {
  ...

  return normalized
}
```

Under the hood this means that if these conditions were not followed during the program being run, an error would be given. The idea of this proposal is to clear the code of treatments that the programmer has to do and to be able to reuse those definitions through the code.

### Import

Add support to **import** notation that, later on, transforms it to desired NAMESPACE file:

```TypeR
import sd from stats
import mean from base
import * from graphics
```

The idea to use the match operator is only to use it as a trump card when programing, the NAMESPACE file will import only the used functions.

## Changes from R

- Removing loops as **for**, **while**, **do ... while**;
- Removing the **<<-** operator;
- Changing the `[[ ]]` operator to `[ ]`;
- Changing the `[x, y]` operator to `[x][y]`;
- ...

## Why

The following topics try to clarify the choice of some design decisions.

### Go

As R alone is not a very performative language, Go was chosen to meet such need.

> But why Go and not another language?

The answer is simple, Go is:

- Easy to read and to write tests
- Has a large community and documentation
- Its concurrent design helps when writing a compiler
- ...

#### And why not use toolings to as Lex and YACC

As you can see the processing of language grammar was done without the aid of known tools -- such as [Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_lexical_analyser) and [YACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc) -- but this was due to the examples given in the material used in the [reference](#Reference); as the idea of this project is, besides making a new language by itself, to aid the learning of compilers; this approach had a more didactic aspect involved in it.

This is not to say that in a future version, either by flexibility or performance, the tools already mentioned will not be used.

### Functional approach

The choice of just following the functional paradigm is simply a personal decision, since the main use of R for the project author is for mathematical scenarios. Having a background in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), this has greatly influenced prioritizing such a decision.

Even if it does not have some of the practicalities of the functional paradigm like guards and pattern matching, it may be that if it is possible to emulate such designs they are added to the language.

## TODO

- Right now? Everything, nothing is current working
- Write a draft about the language itself
- **MAYBE** add a way to link a Stack Overflow link to error messages in the VM -- this is a tip from a friend, thank you Lago
- Create syntax support to render Markdown files
- Tooling for TypeR:
  - Create a config file kinda like it [tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) one
  - Create a linter/formatter package for the language so that more flexible patterns are placed and directed to the community to configure them in the way they think best -- [TRLint](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/TRLint)
  - Create a debuger tool
  - Create a testing package
    - Add coverage builtin
    - Add mutation test support to it
  - Support to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in:
    - Linter -- [TRLint](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/TRLint-VSCode)
    - Debuger
    - Testing
  - Create some new tooling like [Monkey Type](https://github.com/instagram/MonkeyType) to migrate R code to TypeR as it is run:
    - That being said, improve this idea by build something "like it" which builds tests cases through the run of the code just so the user approve them later on whether they are consistent or not
  - **MAYBE** a docs package -- [ROxygen](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/) is too good to be ignored, that's why this idea is not really a priority:
    - Add an integration with the linter tool to add Big-O notation to the function documentation
  - Create code analyzer to perform duplicity analysis and other things just as [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) already performs
  - Write another package to compile the TypeR code into [Julia](https://julialang.org/) code or/and Haskell itself
- Help out [Romain](https://community.rstudio.com/t/running-go-code-from-r/2340/3) write a Go to R integration package or even allow such integration into TypeR itself
- Once the language is stabilized, rewrite the basic packages of R in it and possibly compile them into machine code to gain performance
  - Also seek to see a way to distribute task execution on multiple machines similar to [Elixir's interactive shell.](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html)
  - Dream about ARM and RISC V
- Much more

These ideas are "more or less" organized in order of priority, even so it was decided not to order them because it will not necessarily be possible to do them in the proposed order.

### Note

It may take years and years for this project to be ready, but I intend to document each step and then release a series of books or blog posts in an easy and accessible way describing the process of implementing everything from the motive of language creation to the its outcome. This is rather a big project and the idea is that it brings good and great changes.
